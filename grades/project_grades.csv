Your SHAP feature importance plots are fun to read and I see why your interviewees responded well to them. At this point you all know more than me about SHAP, but I'm really excited to try it own in my own work now- thank you for explaining it so clearly.  The contribution to healthcare is clear here, and I appreciate how you didn't get hung up on getting maximal predictive accuracy out of the model- it's so easy to do that, but you came up with a result that's far more interesting. I also appreciated the nuance you brought to individual vs. group-level predictors (how long will THIS person be in the hospital)- this is sophisticated thinking. GitHub ReadMe is extensive AND has a run.sh script?! I sighed with joy.

I was able to connect the dots when I went through the other material.

The blog post was fantastic, with good amount of background information provided. It was interesting, and the format made it very engaging. I would've liked an elaboration of why recall is favoured over precision - it's because (uniquely) in healthcare, I'd rather have a false positive and have to perform additional tests on my patients, rather than risk a false negative. The cost to benefit ratio tilts on the other end of the spectrum here than it would for a different commercial application.

One of my favorite things about your writing is how it synthesizes the existing literature and ongoing work in multimodal hate speech detection. You also use CNN and Bert smartly as baselines, showing a maturity of thought about deep learning as a method. 

Even though you didn't beat the challenge winners, this is excellent work, and I have no doubt that you would've approached their results given enough time. I also think that, based on the tricks that helped them succeed (labeling the gender and race of figures in the memes), simply scaling up your approach with more data and possibly a deeper network  would've gotten you to a similar place.

You had good technical achievements too, including but not limited to the predictive modelling solution for classifying records to zip codes.

There were a couple spots in the write-up which could use clarification: it wasn't obvious to me why you were surprised the PCA components did not have an intuitive relationship with rental success. (Since rental success wasn't -- if I understood correctly -- part of the dimensionality reduction or subsequent unsupervised clustering.) I also wasn't sure how you selected the cluster(s) with the most potential business success.

Your presentation is also solid- the video is sucinct and clear, your writing is conversational and easy to follow. A real pleasure to read.

I do wish that you can go on further in your write-up to expand on the implications of your study, such as these less-obvious features like whether or not a student is an international student, lower-income, or choosing to major in engineering that can influene a prediction. Addtionally, I would also like if you could have delve more into why your models worked better on international students than domestic students, as well as what  implications your project could have in general in the field of eduation and how it could be potentially useful for someone else. But overall this was a great attempt to try to understand the disparity in college student's graduation rates and I applaud this effort.

I really love to see this being an example of applying data science methods into a political science/international studies topicâ€”it certainly is a breathe of fresh air. I espeically find the language model dashboard and hashtags dynamics visualization creative and interesting and lead to conclusions that otherwise would not have been thought of. The only points I took off were for the GitHub instructions, as it didn't contained any steps for how to clone and execute this program on one's local machine. All in all, this is a great project and one that you should all be proud of. Congrats on finishing this program!",10,5,10,35,10,3,2,4,5,84,"Stunning work. You've chosen a fascinating topic, and I enjoyed the theoretical situating of the problem in your write-up. (I sense a constructivist in the house!) The report was detailed, precise and compelling -- especially in its several examples of interpretive insight. (E.g. ""Indeed, our International Relations of Twitter application is a tool for finding the right questions to ask. In this case, what is Russiaâ€™s role in the conflict in Tigray?"" And, ""Russiaâ€™s embassy in South Africa is considered most semantically similar to the Russian Embassies in Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Australia. This is qualitatively interesting, suggesting that America is engaging in an Africa-specific rhetorical strategy, while Russia is targeting rhetoric to middle- and high-income countries more broadly."" More of this in follow-up video walking through a single case study would be very exciting to see.)

Underlying the excellent analytics are a series of strong technical and methodological choices. (Postgres was a good idea, I don't know that a graph database would have obviously been more powerful and performant.) The only reasoning I didn't immediately follow was the choice of Word2Vec for that particular use case. Collecting and analyzing data at this scale without pre-existing infra is an impressive feat. I just wish your repo explained how to locally host the dashboard, and/or you've set one up that I could play with! Fingers crossed you expand the dataset and work on the other next steps you outlined; this is a powerful tool and I'm eager to see what else can be done with it. This absolutely should be widely publicized and used.",10,5,10,35,10,3,2,4,2.5,81.5,101.875,5

There needed to be evidence to prove that your results are independent i.e. not significantly influenced by this feature. Which, logically, I'd assume, is highly significant. Another important feature to consider would be the number of reviews a listing has - that might be an influencing factor as well, and from the perspective of a new AirBnB host, it will be something to keep in mind (for e.g. some hosts leave reminders for reviewing their property around the unit, especially around utilities they provide to generate positive responses).

The Kepler heat map was a really cool choice of data visualisation.

As a side note, the music in the video was distracting. Either the volume had to be lower, speaker audio higher or no music during the actual speaking portion of the video.",10,5,10,32,9,2,2,3,0,73,"Beautiful visualizations and excellent handling of geographic data! The report is very readable and I appreciate the friendly, approachable tone. Great formulation of a business problem, too. 

I had one concern about the modeling approach to do with the feature importance metric:  In a couple places in the report, it reads like importance in terms of fitted model weights & accuracy on held-out data are  interchangeable. But feature importance in a trained random forest model isn't the same as predictive accuracy. It doesn't necessarily follow that a feature with a higher importance score is a ""more accurate"" predictor than a feature with a lower importance. Feature importance is calculated only on the training data set, and there are conditions when it will appear low for a highly predictive feature- such as having two strongly correlated features in your training data. 

Proximity to POIs and features of an AirBnB rental (like # of bedrooms and bathrooms) are possibly quite correlated, because high-density POIs are associated with downtown areas are associated with condos and apartments. So it's not clear how much one predictor is really independent of the other. That needed to be explored more in order to interpret the feature importance scores. 

Your work is a certainly a step towards establishing the importance of POI proximity to a rental! It's clear it really does matter, and you've created a nice method for quantifying the density of POIs. I think to really sell the claim that it's more important than the particulars of the unit, though, you'd need to do further modeling to tease apart the unique contributions of proximity and rental features.",9.5,4.5,10,31.5,8.5,3,2,3.5,0,72.5,91,1

I love the incorporation of visualizations as well as the acknowledgement of potential flaws (post pandemic costs) at every stage of your blog. I think it made it overall an easier and better reading experience. I did find myself wishing for a more thorough conclusion, reviewing what your specific next steps might be and what general conclusions you may have drawn from your work. I also wished there had been more specificity in your comments in the code, and a significantly more thorough README.md walking through each notebooks and specific set-up steps needed. Generally I think the concepts used were well but a final ""polish"" would be needed before being published in a professional context. Great job with the analysis. I look forward to seeing what you all do in the future!",9,5,10,33,10,2,2,3,0,74,"Great job! Your write-up and your video has great visualizations that makes it easier to understand the components of the prediction. Your discussion of the various data methods as it applied to the dataset clearly demonstrates an intuitive understanding of the different methods that exists and what their tradeoffs are. The GitHub page's readme could, however, have been more specific by giving a summation of the project. The code in the Jupyter Notebooks could also benefit from more comments.

I appreciate the thoughtfulness in your approach to the blog post adding in the nuances alongside each visualization and ending with a compelling argument to stay closer to ""reality"". 

 I would note that your Final Results notebook still includes a ""Viz to create"" text and some other TODOs. You're missing a requirements.txt as well, and your code could benefit from additional comments.

GitHub repostiory looks good and looks like quite a bit of work went into fitting together three disparate datasets. The main concern I have is that the modeling approach isn't the same as a causal analysis, so it doesn't seem entirely ideal for the question. In a few places it sounds like the writing assumes causal relationships where only correlations have been shown. Good grasp on coding, data wrangling and multilple visualizations; just watch out for interpreting models carefully.",10,5,10,30,8,4,2,4,0,73,"Really interesting project, great job! I love the consistent focus I felt pushing towards real-world application of the findings. I would be a little cautious of statements that infer causation rather than correlation. I think a strong point for policy recommendations could still be made here with your findings - but use your findings as a base for further exploration given that most of your data is from a rather volatile pandemic economy as well as there are a whole host of other factors affecting the housing market and the rental market, particularly in NYC with one of the most expensive real estate markets in the country. I would have appreciated your conclusion mentioning some of the nuances of last year's pandemic in particular when you noted having 1 year alone of data as being difficult given the more interesting year all have had. 

I found your finding about ""TV"" being a successful indicator of an AirBNB to be fascinating, given that watching TV isn't necessarily the first activity of choice for most tourists in new cities!

This is something I can see many people utilising. The video presentation is well made, utilising the presentation with diagrams helped audience follow the content being conveyed.

I wish you would've given ""Top 5 careers"" that match the text rather than just one specific one, but this is from the end user perspective. 

The README is well written, however, I would've liked a quick ""this is how you can run our code"" section for anyone that wants to run your code locally. There was no requirements.txt.

Beginning with the website itself, the output listed only one job, but in reality people might end up switching between 4-5 jobs in their careers (especially if they don't know it is they want to do yet), and listing only one job seems a bit limiting. The output could also use some visualization markups too, instead of just a simple HTML message. Also, as for the dataset from indeed.com, I don't see how it was mentioned that your team is making sure it was a job that the person is finally ""happy"" in (i.e. a job/industry he or she has been in for 5+ years). (There's also the fact that people that are happy in their job won't be on websites like indeed) As for your GitHub repo, the code seems to be well-commented on but the readme could use an instruction section to help readers set it up on their local machines, and it is missing a requirement.txt.",10,4,8.5,31.5,8,3,0,2,0,67,83.75,2

Your write-up and video went into helpful detail, and showed in-depth understanding of the data sources and their meaning. You convincingly justifed decisions on data processing and other implementation choices, and took extra, professionally-minded steps like compressing the NRSDB dataset. I was intrigued by the excellent application of causal inference methods to the policy data. The repo is on a good path, e.g. with some separation of configuration from code. (Next steps could include moving more of the workflow out of notebooks and into Python modules.) The irradiance dashboard looks great and was fun to play with. (Some explanatory labels may be helpful, depending on your intended audience.) You all identified very promising future steps for the work; in particular, I'd love to see the three somewhat disjoint streams of analysis come together even further, with further analysis of how potential solar energy generation relates to policies and installation costs, etc. Overall, a very ambitious project that brought together a lot of valuable data and analysis.
